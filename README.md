# Intermittent POST Request Body Issue in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js application intermittently fails to receive the body of POST requests.  The issue is characterized by `req.body` being empty or undefined, even though the `express.json()` middleware is correctly configured.  This is often due to incorrect request handling or timing issues.

## Bug Description

A seemingly correctly configured Express.js server intermittently fails to parse the JSON body of incoming POST requests.  This leads to unexpected behavior and errors where data processing relies on the request body.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with a JSON payload.
5. Observe that the request body is sometimes received correctly and other times is missing.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the middleware is correctly applied and that the server is adequately handling requests.  The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates these necessary steps.   The likely cause is related to asynchronous processing and request timing. The bug solution has improved this situation.
